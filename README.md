## Introduction

This project brings back the spirit of classic text-based RPGs, where imagination paints the world and every decision shapes your fate. Built entirely in **C**, it delivers an old-school adventure right in the terminal — no graphics, no hand-holding, just raw storytelling and player choice.

You step into the boots of a wandering hero, exploring, talking with mysterious NPCs, collecting powerful relics, and clashing with deadly foes. Every area hides secrets, and every choice can alter your journey — leading you toward the ultimate showdown against the Queen of Hell... or perhaps a different destiny entirely.

With a built-in save system, you can pause your quest anytime and return later using your name to pick up exactly where you left off — just like the RPGs of old.

It’s a minimalist adventure that proves one thing: you don’t need fancy visuals to tell a dark, compelling story — just courage, curiosity, and a bit of imagination.

## Inspiration

The main inspiration behind this project is the psychological horror visual novel **Slay the Princess**, a game that challenges players morality and perception through dialogue, choice, and atmosphere rather than combat or spectacle. In that game, you’re told to slay a princess locked away in a cabin — but as you progress, nothing is as it seems. The story twists your expectations, forcing you to question your role, your choices, and even your narrator.

This text adventure takes that same philosophical tension — the uncertainty of whether what you’re doing is right — and translates it into a more classic RPG format. While Slay the Princess uses voice acting, visual storytelling, and branching narratives, this project uses pure text and player imagination to achieve a similar emotional depth.

Instead of a single cabin and a single princess, the world expands into multiple areas, enemies, and decisions — but at its core, it shares that same haunting question:
*Are you truly the hero, or just someone trying to convince yourself you are?*

## Gameplay

The gameplay embraces the charm of classic text-based adventures, where every action is chosen through typed commands and every scene unfolds through vivid descriptions. The player arrives and then navigates trough a mysterious castle — entirely through text, immersing themselves in the atmosphere and story rather than visuals.

Each area provides detailed information about the environment, visible items, nearby NPCs, and possible exits. You’ll decide how to move, what to collect, and who to speak with. Whether you’re exploring new areas, interacting with characters, or making moral decisions, every command pushes the story forward.

You’ll encounter friendly NPCs or enemies that test your courage. Items you collect may unlock new paths or turn the tide in battle. The save system lets you record your progress at any time, allowing you to continue your adventure later by simply entering your name and choosing to load your save.

It’s a slow-burn, choice-driven experience where text is your only weapon and curiosity your greatest ally. *Each prompt asks not just what you will do next — but who you’ll become by doing it.*
