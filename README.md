## Introduction

This project brings back the spirit of classic text-based RPGs, where imagination paints the world and every decision shapes your fate. Built entirely in **C**, it delivers an old-school adventure right in the terminal — no graphics, no hand-holding, just raw storytelling and player choice.

You step into the boots of a wandering hero, exploring, talking with mysterious NPCs, collecting powerful relics, and clashing with deadly foes. Every area hides secrets, and every choice can alter your journey — leading you toward the ultimate showdown against the Queen of Hell... or perhaps a different destiny entirely.

With a built-in save system, you can pause your quest anytime and return later using your name to pick up exactly where you left off — just like the RPGs of old.

It’s a minimalist adventure that proves one thing: you don’t need fancy visuals to tell a dark, compelling story — just courage, curiosity, and a bit of imagination.

## Inspiration

The main inspiration behind this project is the psychological horror visual novel **Slay the Princess**, a game that challenges players morality and perception through dialogue, choice, and atmosphere rather than combat or spectacle. In that game, you’re told to slay a princess locked away in a cabin — but as you progress, nothing is as it seems. The story twists your expectations, forcing you to question your role, your choices, and even your narrator.

This text adventure takes that same philosophical tension — the uncertainty of whether what you’re doing is right — and translates it into a more classic RPG format. While Slay the Princess uses voice acting, visual storytelling, and branching narratives, this project uses pure text and player imagination to achieve a similar emotional depth.

Instead of a single cabin and a single princess, the world expands into multiple areas, enemies, and decisions — but at its core, it shares that same haunting question:
*Are you truly the hero, or just someone trying to convince yourself you are?*
